This is just my fiddlings for Advent of Code 2017

I decided to try TypeScript out to see what I could do architecturally, since the puzzles themselves aren't always interesting and I wanted to learn TypeScript more than solve the puzzles.  If you have suggestions for improvements, even not during the event, or wish for clarification, feel free to chat at me about it.
